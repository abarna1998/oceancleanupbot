Goal: Build a working prototype (detection + navigation + reporting) and pilot with a small boat in the confined water body.
Timeline (8–12 weeks):
* Week 1–2: Requirements, dataset collection, repo init, basic API + placeholders.

* Week 3–5: Integrate object detection model (YOLO/Detectron), test on sample images.

* Week 6–7: Implement navigation stack (simulator → lightweight ROS/SLAM), integrate with hardware controller.

* Week 8: OpenAI integration (summaries, multilingual alerts), UI for fishermen.

* Week 9–10: Deploy Docker image, run small-field trial, gather feedback.

* Week 11–12: Iteration, logging, risk fixes, plan scale-up.

Team & Roles:
   * 1 ML engineer (vision models)

   * 1 Embedded/robotics engineer (navigation + hardware)

   * 1 Backend dev (APIs, integrations)

   * 1 Project lead / field liaison (fisherman outreach)

Hardware (prototype):
      * Small autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) or modified kayak (₹60k–₹3L depending on build)

      * Raspberry Pi/Jetson Nano for onboard compute

      * Camera (RGB) + depth sensor (optional)

      * Battery + solar charging (optional)

      * Collection net / small bin

Software & Cloud:
         * FastAPI backend, Docker

         * Optional cloud infra for data (AWS/GCP/Azure) or a low-cost VPS

         * OpenAI API usage for summarization/chat (cost depends on usage)

Estimated budget (prototype): ₹150k–₹800k (high variance based on hardware & sensors)
Risks & Mitigation:
            * Model false positives → collect more labeled data & threshold tuning.

            * Communications loss → implement local autonomy fallback.

            * Mechanical failure → modular design, replaceable parts, quick retrieval.

            * Regulatory / local permissions → coordinate with local maritime authorities.

Success metrics:
               * Detection precision/recall (>80% target after training)

               * Net kg of debris removed in pilot

               * Reduction in fisherman complaints of net damage

               * Positive stakeholder feedback from at least 5 local fishermen
